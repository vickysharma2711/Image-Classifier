# 🌸 Iris Image Classifier

A deep learning project that classifies **Iris flower images** into different species using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with TensorFlow/Keras.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project aims to identify the **species of Iris flowers** from images:
- 🌼 *Iris Setosa*  
- 🌿 *Iris Versicolor*  
- 🌸 *Iris Virginica*

The model automatically learns image features and predicts the correct species with high accuracy.
